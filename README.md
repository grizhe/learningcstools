basic ethical hacking tools developed by Grizhe: learning by following a Udemy course.
DISCLAIMER: I do not take full credit for my code, as I am learning alongside a course, and I am directly copying some lines of code in the course. I do add my own touches to each tool, trying to over-develop in in creating fool-proof, easy-to-use tools.
